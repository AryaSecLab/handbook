PREFACE

I’ve been trying to re-invent and transform myself since last May 2020 into somebody new and fresh with a new career in computer science field. So I’m making a move. I started it all from the scratch because filmmaking has been my skill and educational background. NO previous computer science nor mathematics background at all. 

So I am exploring my new galaxy. I’ve earned certificates of Computer Science, Cryptography, Mathematics Logic, and Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python after finishing the online studies I enrolled in Harvard University Online, Stanford University Online, and Colorado University Online. I also have earned Introduction to Cybersecurity Tools & Cyber Attacks online study certificate authorized by IBM. 

Why cryptography too? Recalling my childhood memory, my grandpa and I used to create unique symbols for all alphabets to write a letter for both of us alone. It makes me now realize that is a little defining moment why I am in love with cryptography.

This book is a compilation of explanation and theory from many readings/sources and meant to be a fundamental introduction with most of quick examples I wrote. I also wrote quick examples by hand in the Cryptography chapter. The main purpose of this book is that I want this book to become a manual handbook I can always personally refer to at a new career in near future hopefully. And I’d like to humbly dedicate this book to my wife, my parents, my grandfather and grand mother who have been very supportive to me in billion ways. I do hope this new skill of mine and the book will be useful and meaningful in broader ways specially to my life and to also the country I was born in, United Republic of Indonesia (NKRI). I would like to dedicate this book to all good people around the globe as well. God bless you all.
